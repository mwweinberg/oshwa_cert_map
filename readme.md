This is the development repo for a live map of OSHWA open source hardware [registrations](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html).  It pulls from the [certification api](https://certificationapi.oshwa.org/documentation).  The map part is based off of the [Leaflet Choropleth Map tutorial](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/).  There is a tutorial on how it works [here](https://michaelweinberg.org/blog/2020/11/10/live-oshwa-certification-map/)
