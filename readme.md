This is the development repo for a live map of OSHWA open source hardware [registrations](https://certification.oshwa.org/list.html).  It pulls from the [certification api](https://certificationapi.oshwa.org/documentation).  The map part is based off of the [Leaflet Choropleth Map tutorial](https://leafletjs.com/examples/choropleth/).

In order to make it run, you will need [your own API key](https://certificationapi.oshwa.org/).  Replace your key for the oshwaKey variable at the top of the the sketch.js file.  These keys expire every 100 days, so if this version of the map isn't loading for you that is where to start troubleshooting.
